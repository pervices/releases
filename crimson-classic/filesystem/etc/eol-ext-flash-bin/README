mcu/bin: avrdude versions of the MCU code.

This code is only required to support external programming, using
the programming dongle for Crimson Classic.

Do not use these binaries with the default AVR tool; you will
break your Crimson Classic unit. These binaries are provided
for End Of Life support only.
